# Navy Instruction Downloader

## Overview

This uses the [GNU wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) to spider the U.S.
Navy's public instructions website ("Department of Navy Issuances") for PDF
files, and downloads them (but no other files) into a dedicated directory.

This could have just been a Github Gist but that doesn't feel like a suitable
format for maintaining codes that have been used in IT projects.
